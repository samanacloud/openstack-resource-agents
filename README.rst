History
-------

Martin Loschwitz started this repository in 2012, hosted at
<https://github.com/madkiss/openstack-resource-agents>,
and together with SÃ©bastien Han and Emilien Macchi contributed
the majority of resource agents.

Martin eventually stepped down from maintainership, and
`in October 2015 the project was moved to StackForge`__.
